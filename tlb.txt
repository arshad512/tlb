Lustre is a distributed filesystem, where individual servers having local disk
is tied together so they present a unified storage, working together coherently.
Data to be written/read is broken in smaller subset(objects or data stripes) and 
stored across the cluster.  In this process Increasing throughput as the read 
or write is happening. 


Lustre is composed of 7 important components.
============================================
1 Client : Combines all the server components and gives a POSIX view of the
	   mountable filesystem. Initiates data request to read or write.
2 MGS	 : Management server - Maintains configuration.
3 MGT	 : Management target - Target for MGS.
4 MDS	 : Metadata server - Manages access to FS (inode, paths, permission).
5 MDT	 : Metadata Target - These are ldiskfs formatted disk where actual 
	   inodes/directores are stored. This holds FS Metadata data.
6 OSS 	 : Object storage server - Manages access to FS data.
7 OST 	 : Object storage target - Holds actual FS data.


PTLRPC
======
All components connect through LNET(TCP/IP or IB Abstraction) layer. RPC is 
build on top of LNET which handles client - server communication.


LDLM
====
Filesystem coherency is achieved using Lustre distributed lock manager(LDLM). 
LDLM provides a unified view of locks to all participating server and clients.
All access to resources(metadata, data) is serialised. LDLM works by 
maintaining a global lock queue. Every time there is need to obtain lock, it 
enqueues the lock to this global queue. Once the lock is relinquish by the 
resource it is dequeued. There are three global queue - 
1. Granted 	- Locks are successfully taken
2. Converting 	- Locks are demoting
3. Blocked	- Locks cannot be granted.
LDLM uses 'call-backs' or AST to notify process that the work is done or some
attention is required.


Replay & Failover
=================
Disks are protected by RAID. Lustre have no control on them. Nodes failover (HA)
are managed by Lustre. Heartbeat is setup between primary and secondary nodes 
using either pacemaker or coresync. If primary fails, there is an attempt to 
umount() primary first. If that takes long, the primary is STONITH (killed 
forcefully).  Meanwhile secondary node is mounted. Upon successful re-connection 
of client, it check the pending TID (Transaction ID) against the LAST_RECV and 
replays all the TID greater than equal to TID.

Client					Server
======					======
00. Client sends RPC Request + XID	01. Server uses XID as descriptor for 
					completing the requested task.
					
					03. Server Sends back TID.

04. Client queues TID. And waits
for completion event on XID.		05. Meanwhile server executes the
					Request.

					06. After completion or failure of 
					request. Server sends back response
					with return status.
07. Client check the response
and drops the TID from the queue.
(Job is completed)


LLOG
====
Llog or lustre logs are transaction logs in Lustre. It helps in maintaining a 
'atomic' commit during distributive transaction. For example, an unlink starts 
at MDS and completes on OSS. It also maintains the whole cluster wide 
configuration.


Layout & objects
================
Layouts are maps which points the combination of IO offset and size to one or 
more objects, which may or may not be residing on separate OST. Layouts are 
kept in EA. During the time of file create or open, the MDT reads and maps 
layout using Object Index (OI) to retrive the FID. FID now has all the 
information to do IO independent of MDT. Objects are store house for data 
within OST. Objects are stored in O/0/d* format on the OSTs. During the creating 
of the file the objects can be specified in the form of 'stripe count'. This 
until now would be frozen until the file is migrated (see pfl). If stripe count 
is greater than 1, then part of object hold part of file. This also increase the 
parellism while doing the actual IO. If stripe count is 1, the single object is 
the whole file. Not a clever, layout selection in case there are lots of data 
to be written or read. 

system call path under Lustre
=============================

Client					Server
======					======
00. Client makes a POSIX system call	

01. llite/file.c -> Entry point. Traps 
it and does a sanity check. If not 
sane it throws a ENOSUPRT and returns.

02. llite/vvp_io.c -> Get locks on 
range if any and initiate clio for IO.	
(IO loops within...) and calls
clio_end.

03. Before clio_end - Call osc_io.c
to prepare RPC and send it across to 
server.	At this point, vvp_object 
(inode) and cl_object (page) is 
prepared.
					04. Server receives RPC and does a
					sanity check on it.

					05. Through dt_object (points to ldiskfs
					operations) invoke ldiskfs to make 
					actual FS modification.

					06. Server returns RPC.

07. Client receives RPC and
take appropriate action on it
and passes on to application.

Mapping Inode to Data
=====================

This form of debugging is required when there is suspicion that the layout is
corrupted. Given just the pathname we could get the data contents. This type
of debugging also verifies the metadata (inode) correctly mapps to data.
